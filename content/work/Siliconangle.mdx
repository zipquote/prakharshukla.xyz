I worked on revamping the website by redesigning the wordpress theme of the website based on the new design provided by SiliconANGLE's design partner.

My work entailed, migrating existing blog to the new design which was previously based on divi builder plugin. Creating new templates, custom fields using ACF plugin, a custom newsletter plugin to send weekly updates based on user preferences. A custom search page to fetch results via WP-REST API.
