In this tutorial, I'll be going over how I built the typewriter effect on one of my websites with a little bit of JavaScript and some tea in the afternoon.

There are quite a few tutorials, that go about achieving this. There are some very clever ones using Pure CSS and even an NPM package that provides this and much more.

However, I'm not very clever with CSS and I didn't want to add a few KB's to my bundle for a simple thing. Plus it's a bit of practice and some good fun to build one by myself.

### Setup

First we create an HTML file with following bit of code.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Typewriter Effect</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/style.css" />
    <script src="/script.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="text">
      <span id="typewriter"></span>
      <span class="cursor-blinking">|</span>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

Just a basic template for us to get started with. `#typewriter` is where our text would go and following that we have a blinking cursor. Let's add some CSS to have our cursor blinking.

```css
.text {
  font-size: 4rem;
}

@keyframes blinking {
  0% {
    color: transparent;
  }
  50% {
    color: inherit;
  }
  100% {
    color: transparent;
  }
}

.cursor-blinking {
  animation: 1s blinking step-end infinite;
}
```

This will :

* Render our text, nice and big.
* Register a `keyframe` animation that repeats every **1s** **infinitely** switching text color from `transparent` to `inherit` giving us our **blinking cursor**.

### JavaScripty Bit

I first wrote this code with a bunch of `functions` and later refactored it into a `class` .

```javascript
class TypeWriter {
  constructor(words, element) {
    this.words = words;
    this.element = element;
    this.rafReference = null;
  }
}
```

We will create a `class` **TypeWriter** which would accept an array of **words** and a DOM Node **element**.

Now we need to loop over this **array of words**. So we'll create a method on our class called `loop`.

```javascript
  loop(fn, dt) {
    let raf;
    let dateTime = dt;
    const currentTime = new Date().getTime();
    const delta = currentTime - dateTime;

    if (delta >= 250) {
      dateTime = currentTime;
      fn(raf);
    }

    this.rafReference = requestAnimationFrame(() => {
      this.loop(fn, dateTime);
    });
  }
```

Here, we're calculating `delta` between our `currentTime` and previous `dateTime` and if `delta` is more than `250ms`, we call our **callback function**.

Magic number **250** is the time it takes an average typist to type a character assuming an average person types 50-60 words per minute and an average word is 5-4 characters long. Adjust it as you see fit.

Using `requestAnimationFrame` we can tell the browser to call a function before next repaint. we thus, recursively call `loop` method with `callback` and current `dateTime` as arguments.

We'll now update our constructor :

```javascript
constructor(words, element) {
    this.words = words;
    this.wordIdx = 0; //Current Word Index
    this.charIdx = 0; //Current character Index
    this.charIncrementor = 1; //Increment character by 1
    this.element = element;
    this.delay = 5;//Wait time it takes to type 5 chars at end
    this.currWord = this.words[this.wordIdx]; //Current Word
    this.rafReference = null;
}
```

Next we add an `init` method to initialise animation and `incrementCharacters` to type one character at a time.

```javascript
incrementCharacters() {
    this.charIdx += this.charIncrementor;
}
```

```javascript
animate(word, end) {
    this.element.innerHTML = word.substring(0, end);
}

init(fn) {
    this.loop(() => {
      this.incrementCharacters(); //Increment characterIndex
	  // Type character on the screen at a time.
      this.animate(this.words[this.wordIdx], this.charIdx);
    }, new Date().getTime());
  }
```

We would now like to wait sometime when we're done typing and then delete the characters we've typed on the screen.

```javascript
if (this.charIdx === this.currWord.length + this.delay) {
  //Remove characters now that we've reached end of the word.
  this.charIncrementor = -1;
}
```

We'd like to move onto next word when we're done with our current word. Hence,

```javascript
nextWord() {
    this.wordIdx += 1;
    this.charIncrementor = 1;
    this.currWord = this.words[this.wordIdx];
}

if (this.charIdx === 0) {
    // When all characters of previous word have been hidden.
    this.nextWord();
}
```

When we're done with last word, we'd like to start again in a loop with the first word in array.

```javascript
reset() {
    this.wordIdx = 0;
    this.charIdx = 0;
    this.charIncrementor = 1;
    this.currWord = this.words[this.wordIdx];
}

if (this.wordIdx === this.words.length) {
   //Start again from first word now that we have reached end.
   this.reset();
}
```

When using something like React, we'd like to clear all animations when component unmounts which is how I'm currently using this animation. We'll add a `destroy` function. This is where our `this.rafReference` will be required.

```javascript
destroy() {
    cancelAnimationFrame(this.rafReference);
}
```

Finally we'll update our HTML file.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Typewriter Effect</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/style.css" />
    <script src="/script.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="text">
      <span id="typewriter"></span>
      <span class="cursor-blinking">|</span>
    </div>
    <script>
      const words = ['Bananas', 'Apples', 'Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit Amet'];
      const typewriter = document.getElementById('typewriter');
      const writer = new TypeWriter(words, typewriter);
      writer.init();
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```
